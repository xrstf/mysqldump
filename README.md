mysqldumper
===========

This is just a simple, Go-only dumper for MySQL/MariaDB databases. Dumps
generated by this tool are optimized for diffing dumps, so that committing them
to a VCS repository is as space efficient as possible. Also, it provides a
sorely missed ``-skip-tables`` CLI flag to make life just a tiny bit easier.

Installation
------------

    go get https://github.com/xrstf/mysqldump
